# Chess-Total-War

This application was coded using Java and JavaFX.

Chess Total War is a 2 player GUI based chess application game except with modified rules!
Pieces have different movement patterns and there are different criteria for winning.

Some of these changes in rules and piece movement include:
1. No concept of check or checkmate, the King must be killed inorder to win.
2. Pawns can move backwards and diagnally as well as kill in any direction (effectively becomming kings).
3. No pawn promotion, total war is an all out war!
4. A stalemate is induced if both players are reduced to 3 pieces or less each.
